We provide our code to support the reproducibility of results
presented in the VI_Linc paper. However, we do not share models
or datasets. The sources of the datasets we used are referenced 
in the paper.

## Abstract / Overview
Detecting minority class nodes is particularly challenging due to the inherent 
structural diversity of the patterns and the limited availability of labeled 
training data. Conventional graph learning methods are not explicitly designed 
for imbalanced settings and often fail to generalize class-specific patterns 
from sparse and heterogeneous examples. To address these challenges, we propose
VI-LINC, a novel approach for visual representation learning on graphs tailored 
to imbalanced node classification. 
VI-LINC introduces a structured visual representation of local graph neighborhoods as
a basis for forming class-specific pattern clusters in a visual embedding space,
improving class-discriminative pattern extraction and generalization. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate that VI-LINC consistently outper-
forms state-of-the-art methods for imbalanced node classification, achieving an
increase of up to 15.45% in precision, 2.13% in recall, and 43.34% f1-score for the
macro scores on real-world data. For graph patterns with more complex struc-
ture - specifically nodes with 3 or more 1-hop neighbours, VI-LINC achieves an
18.17% improvement in precision, 8.57% in recall, and 15.09% in f1-score on the
minority class for a real-world dataset.
